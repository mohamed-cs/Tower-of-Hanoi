#ðŸ“Œ Tower-of-Hanoi
<p>The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape.</p>
